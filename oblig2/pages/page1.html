        <h2> Introduction </h2>
        <p class = "introduction"> 
          With the advent of digital media, the potential for fake news, bullshit and alternative facts have proliferated. 
          The creation of images, sound and text through artificial intelligence could increase the speed and scale of this 
          phenomenon and drastically influence how we interpret current events, further influencing our political attitudes 
          and elections. The use of AI-generated images have already been used in the U.S election campaign leading up to
          the coming 2024 Presidential Election. In 2025 Norway will host its Parliamentary Election, how should we prepare 
          for the use of this technology? Should the goverment propose a law on how to deal with the use of AI in political 
          campaigns and elections?
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading-positive">  Positive aspects of the proposed laws: </h2>
        <p class="paragraph-positive"> 
          Authencity: The law would help to prevent AI - generated content which could deceive voters.
          This will produce a more trustworthy political enviroment. <br>
          Protection: Banning AI - content could reduce the spread of false and incorrect information. 
          This could ensure more accurate and reliable information voters have before making their decision. <br>
          Fair and equal opportunities: Banning AI content and materials will even out the difference 
          between candidates that have more AI resources.
        </p>
        <h2 class="heading-negative">  Negative aspects of the proposed laws:  </h2>
        <p class="paragraph-negative"> 
          Audience: Banning AI could affect the audience negatively and reduce engagement. Hindering potential campaign strategies. <br>
          Enforcement:  Enforcing such law could be hard. Experienced individuals could generate AI content and still remain under radar. 
          It will also be challenging to distinguish between AI content and human content. <br>
          Regulations: Banning AI content could create un-regulated AI driven campaigns. This could encourage more deceptive practices.
