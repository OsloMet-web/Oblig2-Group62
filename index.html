       <h1> DATA1100, Mandatory Assignment Module 0: Group Work </h1>
        <h2><strong> 1. Immediate reactions </strong></h2>
            <p>Discuss your immediate reactions to working in a group with strangers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Working in groups with strangers can be uncomfortable the first time</li>
                <li>Groupds tend to have more diverse viewpoints with different perspectives</li>
                <li>In a group you get to share workload which is great for big assignments</li>
            </ul>

        <h2><strong> 2. Identify the Situation </strong></h2>
            <p> What type of cases, problems or issues lend themselves to be discussed in groups?<br> 
                Why not just do it individually?</p> 
            <p>
                Discussions in groups tend to work better in situations where there is a demand for diverse perspectives, creativity and collaborations.  
                In situations where there are no clear or definite answers, discussions in groups are better. 
                We can get different perspectives from people from different backgrounds. 
                The best discussions tend to be between those with a decent amount of disagreements. 
                It is in this way that people, as a group, look at different perspectives, mix them and deliver a task that discusses a lot. 
                In addition, groupwork also becomes more interesting, rather than working on complex problems on your own.  
                On the other hand, individual work might be more beneficial in situations requiring deep focus/work & efficiency.
