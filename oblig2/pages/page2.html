  <h1> <strong> Fake news and critical thinking in the digital era</strong></h1>
  
  <h2> With the advent of digital media, the potential for fake news, bullshit and alternative facts have proliferated.
  The creation of images, sound and text through artificial intelligence could increase the speed and scale of this phenomenon
  and drastically influence how we interpret current events, further influencing our political attitudes and elections.</h2>
  <h2> The use of AI-generated images have already been used in the U.S election campaign leading up to the coming 2024 Presidential Election. 
  In 2025 Norway will host its Parliamentary Election, how should we prepare for the use of this technology? </h2>
